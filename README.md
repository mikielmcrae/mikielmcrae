I love picking up new skills - I'm currently looking deeper into game dev with JavaScript, and introducing React into my stack!

🎮 💻

My favorite parts of development are that the learning never stops, and the satisfaction of figuring something out never dulls.

🧠 🫀

I'm interested in full-stack development, namely web app design and development, and more recently, game design. I'm also interested in cloud technology,  software as a service, AI and ML.

💻 🧠 💭 🌐

My passion is creating software that feels as interactive as possible to users, as if it's conscious. I think empathy for users is what backs the best software. An avid technology user myself, my best user experiences have been those where I forget I'm even interacting with a piece of software, and it just feels like something that should be there.

I also love espresso, animals (especially my dog Georgie), vegan things, gaming, Philosophy, history, etymology, mechanical pencils and mechanical keyboards, and a lot of other little things.
