-Hello! 
Exploring what I like and trying to learn a lot more along the way. I love logic, philosophy, and more recently, js :)
Formerly self-taught, current higher diploma in computing science student based in dublin, IE.
Here, I usually just post my practice problem solving and tasks/mini-projects that help me learn.
Always learning!
