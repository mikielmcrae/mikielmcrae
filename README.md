Developer based in Dublin, IE!

🌱🌱🌱

I love all things software development. I never really felt creative until I learned how to code. My experience is mostly in

-Java, JavaFX

-Python

-SQL

-HTML/CSS/JavaScript

-PHP

I'm currently looking deeper into game dev with JavaScript, and introducing React into my stack!

My favorite parts of development are that the learning never stops, and the satisfaction of figuring something out never dulls.

I'm interested in full-stack development, namely web app design and development, and more recently, game design. I'm also interested in cloud technology,  softwware as a service, and Artificial Intelligence.

My passion is creating software that feels as interactive as possible to users, as if it's conscious. I think empathy for users is what backs the best software. An avid technology user myself, my best user experiences have been those where I forget I'm even interacting with a piece of software, and it just feels like something that should be there.



I also love espresso, animals (especially my dog Georgie), vegan things, gaming, Philosophy, history, etymology, mechanical pencils and mechanical keyboards, and a lot of other little things.
